## Description

The trunk rod holder on my Honda Beat was broken when I got the car, and 3D printing seemed like a better option than trying to import one from Japan. There was already a model for this part floating around the internet and, while functional, it doesn't resemble the original part at all.

I found some [photos of the real part](https://yahoo.aleado.com/lot?auctionID=r1104154156) ([local mirror](../assets/img/3d-printing/i-img1024x768-1693139816ygbjbz28.jpg)) on Yahoo! Auctions and attempted to recreate it. Ultimately, I'm pretty happy with the result. This part is of similar design and dimensions to the original. The biggest change is that I filled in the sides to make the part more durable and easier to print.

I printed the part in ABS because it has greater flexibility and heat resistance than PLA, but I may try other materials in the future.
